- `styles.css`: External file containing all the styles applied to the site.
- `README.md`: Document explaining the project and the resources used.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 (semantic)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, transitions)
- Google Fonts (Roboto)

## Main Sections
### 1. Personal Presentation
Located in the `<section id="presentacion">` section, it includes a brief description of the developer.

### 2. Portfolio
Located in `<section id="portafolio">`, it presents three simulated projects using `article` within a `projects` div with a `CSS Grid` layout and hover effects.

### 3. Contact
In `<section id="contacto">`, there is a basic form with inputs for name, email, and a text field for a message.

## Responsive Design

- Adapts to desktop, tablet (768px), and mobile (480px) screens.

## Interactivity
